# Number Inspector: Prime Check & Factor Explorer

## Overview

Number Inspector is a small Python utility that helps you explore integers.  
Given a number, it will:

- Tell you if the number is a **prime**.
- List **all factors** of the number in ascending order.

This is a simple project that demonstrates clean structure, basic algorithms, and a tiny command line interface.
